# SimpleSpectrumAnalyzer
A simple rtl-sdr spectrum analyzer used for measuring signal strength
in a small bandwidth.

It is written in python 3.

I use it for measuring constructive and destructive interference of a harmonic of a 50 MHz signal (from a clock oscillator).  This allows measurements of wavelength and frequency, and thus an indirect measurement of the speed of radio waves.
